# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Add entries to `[Unreleased]` as you work — manual bullets always win over the
git-cliff auto-fill (config: `cliff.toml`). On release, promote `[Unreleased]`
to a dated version section.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project skeleton.
- Command-line surface: the `run`, `inspect`, `cancel`, and `kill` subcommands
  are parsed and validated, including `run`'s verbatim `-- <program> <args...>`
  tail.
- `run` execution: launches the program shell-free inside a ProcessKit
  `ProcessGroup` the runner owns (in `--cwd`, defaulting to the current
  directory), echoes the child's stdout/stderr live through ProcessKit's pipes
  (pipe + echo, so the child sees no TTY — colors/progress bars may degrade),
  and forwards the child's exit code exactly. Runner-own failures use the
  reserved `100..=119` band (`SPAWN`/`BACKEND`/`INTERNAL`). When `run` returns,
  the container is torn down by the group's kernel-backed kill-on-drop, so leaked
  descendants do not survive. `--create-no-window` is proxied to
  `Command::create_no_window()` (default off).
- `run` now enforces `--timeout` and `--grace` and handles `Ctrl-C`, all as
  **distinguishable** endings that share one teardown path. A `--timeout` that
  elapses exits with the reserved `TIMEOUT` code (106); a `Ctrl-C` cancel exits
  with the reserved `CANCELLED` code (107) — each distinct from the other and from
  a forwarded child code — with an explanatory line on stderr. Both first ask the
  tree to stop, wait out `--grace`, then let the owning container's kill-on-drop
  hard-tear-down the whole tree, so no descendant survives either ending.
  `--timeout`/`--grace` accept a small duration grammar (`ms`/`s`/`m`/`h`, integer,
  default `s`); a malformed value is a usage error (100). On Windows, where the
  ProcessKit kernel has no soft-terminate tier yet, no soft signal is sent — the
  grace window elapses and the Job Object is then killed atomically, and the runner
  reports this honestly rather than implying a graceful stop. (The machine-readable
  JSONL form of these outcomes lands with the event schema.)
- Documented runner exit-code contract (`docs/exit-codes.md`) that keeps the
  runner's own failures in a reserved code band, separate from the child's
  exit code, and now assigns `TIMEOUT` (106) and `CANCELLED` (107).
- Versioned JSONL event schema (v1): `run` now writes a stream of lifecycle
  events to the `--jsonl` file — one JSON object per line, each with a
  `schema_version`, and never to stdout. The stream covers `run_started` (run id,
  root PID, containment mechanism, working directory), `members_snapshot`,
  `root_exited`, the `cleanup_started` / `cleanup_finished` teardown pair,
  `timeout` / `cancelled`, launch and container errors, and a terminal
  `runner_exit` that preserves the child's own code even on the runner's own
  failure — so a child's code is never lost or aliased. The command line is
  redacted by default (raw argv only under `--argv-raw`; the redaction hash and
  worker-shape hint are reserved fields), and member snapshots are PID-only with
  the richer per-member fields declared but absent until ProcessKit-rs ships them.
  Normative reference in `docs/schema.md`; golden sample stream published at
  `fixtures/schema/v1/events.jsonl` and gated by a golden test. `--run-id` and
  `--argv-raw` are now consumed.
- Dependencies on `processkit` (the containment backbone), `tokio` (its async
  runtime), `clap` (CLI parsing), and `serde` / `serde_json` (the JSONL event
  schema).

### Changed
- `inspect`, `cancel`, and `kill` remain unimplemented and still exit with the
  runner-range "not implemented" code; `run` no longer does.
- `run`'s `--jsonl` is now consumed (the JSONL event stream above); only
  `--capture-dir` remains parsed but not yet consumed.

### Fixed
